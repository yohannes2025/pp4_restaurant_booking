      * Table selection (optional).
      * Customer name, phone number, email (required fields).
    - **My Bookings Page:** (If user accounts are implemented) List all bookings for the user, with options to view details and cancel.
  + **UI Considerations:**
    - **Responsive Design:** Bootstrap is used which is essential for mobile users.
    - **Calendar/Time Selection:** Appropriate UI widgets used (e.g., a calendar for date selection, a time picker or a time dropdown).
    - **Clear Information Display:** Ensure that booking information and restaurant details are easy to read and understand.

1. **Django Backend Development**

* **Project and App Setup:** Similar to the previous example.
* **Models (in restaurant/models.py):** (See above)
* **Admin Interface:** Register models in restaurant/admin.py
* **Authentication:** Django's built-in authentication. A Package django-allauth has been used
* **User Roles & Permissions:** The administrator can give permissions to users based on the roles, e.g., can\_manage\_bookings, can\_manage\_menu, can\_view\_restaurant\_details.
